Task 5

# Capture and Analyze Network Traffic Using Wireshark.

## Objective
Capture live network packets and identify basic protocols and traffic types.

### Tools Used

- **Wireshark (free).** Wireshark is a network protocol analyzer (or packet sniffer). It is used to capture, view, and analyze network traffic in real time or from saved capture files.
## Steps

Below are the key steps taken in this process:

### 1. Install Wireshark.

download wireshark here

### 2. List current firewall rules.

sudo ufw status numbered

### 3. Add a rule to block inbound traffic on a specific port (e.g., 23 for Telnet).

sudo ufw deny proto tcp from any to any port 23 comment 'Block-Telnet'

### 4. Add rule to alow SSH (port 22) if on Linux

- sudo ufw allow 22/tcp
- sudo ufw allow ssh
- sudo ufw enable
- sudo ufw status numbered

### 5. Remove the test block rule to restore original state

sudo ufw delete 1
sudo ufw delete 2

### 5. Conclusion

successfully configured and tested firewall rules to allow or block traffic, gaining hands-on experience in managing network traffic and understanding how firewalls filter connections to enhance system security.
